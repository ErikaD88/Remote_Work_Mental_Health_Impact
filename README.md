Intro:  
We wanted to look at the relationship between remote work and mental health because remote work has become the new normal, especially since the pandemic in 2020.  The dataset collected 5,000 records worldwide to see how remote work affected stress levels, work/life balance, mental health conditions, job satisfaction, etc.  This raised some interesting questions for our group and we decided to dig a little deeper, focusing mostly on the North American region.

Question 1:  
How do stress levels vary across different industries in remote work environments?  Curtis McMullen/Jim Cruz

Question 2:
What is the impact of remote work on social isolation and work/life balance?

Question 3:
What is the prevalence of mental health conditions among remote workers?  Atnafu Ayalew/Alison Driscoll
We filtered the data to look specifically at North American remote workers.  Of the 264 workers, 193 of them have a mental health condition.  There were 3 conditions listed:  depression, burnout and anxiety.  The breakdown is evenly split between the 3 conditions for remote workers.  We represented the data in a bar chart to show them side by side and then a pie chart to show the breakdown in percentages.
We further looked at how the data broke down by gender.  We had 4 categories of gender listed:  Female, Male, Non-Binary and Prefer Not to Say.  We created the bar chart visualization to show side by side comparison and also broke it down in percentages in a pie chart.

Question 4:
How do the number of hours worked per week and regional differences impact employee productivity in remote work environments in North America vs. Asia? Erika Dorsainvil/Lorelei Legg/Patrick Feeney





Our final analysis:
1) In this study, 73% of the North American remote workers have a mental health condition.  It is evenly split between depression, burnout and anxiety.
2) Female remote workers are experiencing depression at a higher rate and male remote workers are experiencing anxiety at a higher rate.
