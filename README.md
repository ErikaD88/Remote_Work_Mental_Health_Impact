Intro:  
We wanted to look at the relationship between remote work and mental health because remote work has become the new normal, especially since the pandemic in 2020.  The dataset collected 5,000 records worldwide to see how remote work affected stress levels, work/life balance, mental health conditions, job satisfaction, etc.  This raised some interesting questions for our group and we decided to dig a little deeper, focusing mostly on the North American region.

Question 1:  
How do stress levels vary across different industries in remote work environments?  Curtis McMullen/Jim Cruz
For North America stress levels vary across different industries. We found that for the most part remote work was less stressful than the work locations. This was suprising due to the lack of cummuting, planning meals, childcare, and using sick time. We created a chart to show the side by side comparison of industries and work locations grouped together.
One area that was particularly interesting was the healthcare industry. Remote workers in this industry had the highest stess rate. We dug deeper into the data and analyzed the healthcare industry by job title. We created a chart illustrating the results and saw that both HR and Marketing had the highest stresslevels by far. This could be due to their job requirement to interact with the workforce.

Question 2:
What is the impact of remote work on social isolation and work/life balance? Justin Crockett and Amy Goodwin

We looked at remote work's effect on social isolation and work/life balance amoung North American workers. Our data was made up of a total of 2308 and 2340 responses for social isolation rating and work/life balance rating respectively. The responces for each category came in the form of a 1-5 rating. To analyze the impact of remote work on these ratings we compared how the ratings differed across three types of work locations: remote work, hybrid work, and onsite work. For social isolation we made a stacked bar chart that broke the ratings for each location down into a segment of the bar for the corresponding location. In addition we calculated the mean, mode and standard deviation to look for differences across locations. We found that on average work location had no statistically signifcant affect on social isolation. However we did find that the standard deviation and mode indicated that remote work was likely to create extreme social isolation. For the second part of our question we created three side by side pie charts. Again broken down by work location. This time we used the percentage of each responce to generate the pie slices. We found that like social isolation, remote work has very little effect on work/life balance across the sample size. However again we found that remote work was more likely to produce extreme responces compared to the other two work locatons. It has the highest standard deviation and the a mode of 1 indicating the worst work life balance. Overall we determined that remote work does not have a significant impact on social isolation or work life balance across a large enough sample size, but remote work is more likely to produce extreme feelings of social isolation and work/life imbalance. 

Question 3:
What is the prevalence of mental health conditions among remote workers?  Atnafu Ayalew/Alison Driscoll

We filtered the data to look specifically at North American remote workers.  Of the 264 workers, 193 of them have a mental health condition.  There were 3 conditions listed:  depression, burnout and anxiety.  The breakdown is evenly split between the 3 conditions for remote workers.  We represented the data in a bar chart to show them side by side and then a pie chart to show the breakdown in percentages.
We further looked at how the data broke down by gender.  We had 4 categories of gender listed:  Female, Male, Non-Binary and Prefer Not to Say.  We created the bar chart visualization to show side by side comparison and also broke it down in percentages in a pie chart.

Question 4:
How do the number of hours worked per week and regional differences impact employee productivity in remote work environments in North America vs. Asia? Erika Dorsainvil/Lorelei Legg/Patrick Feeney

In North America, productivity changes are relatively balanced across the 21-40 and 41-60 hour bins, with many employees reporting "No Change" or an "Increase" in productivity. In contrast, Asia shows a greater occurrence of "Decrease" in productivity within these same hour ranges, indicating potential challenges associated with longer working hours in remote settings.

Both regions have minimal representation in the 61-80 hour bin, suggesting that few employees work extensive hours. Despite this, productivity outcomes in this category vary significantly. North America shows more stable and positive productivity trends, while Asia has more variation and challenges. This could be due to differences in culture, workplace practices, or resources. These results suggest the importance of creating remote work policies and support systems that are tailored to the unique needs of each region.





Our final analysis:
1) In this study, 73% of the North American remote workers have a mental health condition.  It is evenly split between depression, burnout and anxiety.
2) Female remote workers are experiencing depression at a higher rate and male remote workers are experiencing anxiety at a higher rate.
3) Recommendation: Organizations should consider monitoring and limiting work hours to optimize productivity and employee well-being.
4) Stress levels across the industries in North America for each work location were very similar, but remote workers showed less stress overall.
